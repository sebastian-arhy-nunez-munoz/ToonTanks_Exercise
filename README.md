A simple Unreal Engine / C++ exercise where you're a Tank that will destroy four towers

There's a problem with the code, that implice that you have to delete de Intermediate folder and then rebuilding it compiling into Unreal. I don't know why but there
was a very heavy file taht couldn't get pushed. So I have to delete it. Sorry for the problems and thank you
